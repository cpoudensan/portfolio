# My Projects

This repository is a central hub for all my personal (& teamwork) learning projects.
Each project is developed in its own GitHub repository and is listed here
to provide a clear and organized overview of my work.

## Projects
- **Client–Server Application – Shortest Path Calculation (Go)**  
A client–server application written in Go that computes the shortest path and minimum distance between two cities.  
The server implements Dijkstra’s algorithm on a weighted graph representing cities and distances, while the client sends textual route requests and receives the optimal path and distance.  
The server supports multiple concurrent clients using goroutines: [go_project](https://github.com/TON_USER/go_project)
